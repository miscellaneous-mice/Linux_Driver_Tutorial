## Block device file
---

- Reading or writing blocks for memory (like for sd card : mmcblk0)


---
## Character device file
---

- Reading or writing stream of bytes into memory (like serial port : tty50)

## SD card driver

### ðŸ”¹Â `mmcblk0`

- `mmc`Â =Â **MultiMediaCard**Â (covers SD, microSD, and eMMC devices).
- `blk`Â =Â **block device**Â (Linux treats storage devices as block devices).
- `0`Â = the first MMC device detected (if you had multiple cards/eMMC chips, youâ€™d also seeÂ `mmcblk1`,Â `mmcblk2`, â€¦).

So:  
ðŸ‘‰Â `mmcblk0`Â = theÂ **whole SD/eMMC device**Â (likeÂ `/dev/sda`Â for hard drives).

---
### ðŸ”¹Â `mmcblk0p1`,Â `mmcblk0p2`, â€¦

- `p1`,Â `p2`, â€¦ = partitions on that device.
    
- Example:
    - `mmcblk0p1`Â â†’ theÂ **first partition**Â (on Raspberry Pi OS this is the FAT32Â `/boot`Â partition).
    - `mmcblk0p2`Â â†’ theÂ **second partition**Â (typically the root filesystemÂ `/`).
        

So:  
ðŸ‘‰Â `mmcblk0p1`Â =Â **partition 1 of the first MMC device**.  
ðŸ‘‰Â `mmcblk0p2`Â =Â **partition 2 of the first MMC device**, and so on.

---
### ðŸ”¹ Typical Raspberry Pi setup

On a Pi booting from microSD:
- `/dev/mmcblk0`Â â†’ the entire SD card. 
- `/dev/mmcblk0p1`Â â†’ the smallÂ **boot**Â partition (FAT32, ~256 MB).
- `/dev/mmcblk0p2`Â â†’ the largerÂ **root**Â partition (ext4, takes the rest of the card).

## Screen command
---
### ðŸ”¹ WhatÂ `screen`Â is

- `screen`Â is aÂ **terminal multiplexer**Â (lets you run multiple terminal sessions inside one).
- But it also doubles as a very simpleÂ **serial terminal**Â program:
	- `screen /dev/serial0 9600`
	- means: *open the serial deviceÂ /dev/serial0Â at 9600 baud and connect my keyboard/screen to it.*

So when you type characters,Â `screen`Â sends themÂ **out the serial port**.  
Anything received on that port is displayed back in your terminal.

### ðŸ”¹ Why you need it for UART testing

On the Raspberry Pi:
- **TX pin (Pin 8)**Â â†’ sends data.
- **RX pin (Pin 10)**Â â†’ receives data.
    
If you short TX and RX, then:
- Whatever you type inÂ `screen`Â goes TX â†’ RX â†’ back into the Pi.
- `screen`Â shows you what came back.  
	- This is called aÂ **loopback test**.
- Thatâ€™s whatÂ `screen`Â saves you from â€” it just lets you interactively talk to the serial port.

---

âœ…Â **So in short:**  
`screen`Â is just a program that opens your UART device (likeÂ `/dev/serial0`) and lets you type and see data over serial â€” like a chat window between your keyboard and the Piâ€™s serial pins.
